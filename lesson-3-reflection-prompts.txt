When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

-You want to back up your data off-site
-You want to collaborate with others remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Something might change while you're working on it.
-You want predictable behavior, only changing things when you decide to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

-Forks are a credited split off from an existing repository on github
  -Used when you want to continue someone else's project and make it your own 
-Clones are a copy of a repository on git
  -Used whenever you want to make a copy of a repository
-Branches are a split off within a repository
  -Used when you want to edit the project in some way seperate from the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

-Useful for comparing what has changed since last time you synced up with github
-Can be used to help automatically merge files by comparing the previous state with
local changes and online changes
